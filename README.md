## videoOpener
This app needs direct streamable Video URL to work. You may find videos at [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies)

### Motivation

1. Low brigntness of MX Player is not low enough. But my phone's stock Video Player app has minimum brightness possible.
2. Phone's stock video player cannot accept direct video url but it can stream video if direct streamable link is passed via different app. This app acts as middle man to pass the link to app via `Intent Filter`.
